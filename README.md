# Wiider
A portmanteau of Wikipedia and spider, Wiider is a wiki-spider in < 100 lines. 

The project was inspired by a coworker's joke about Wikipedia races, where two people start on the same page & work their way towards another page only by following links, i.e. Abraham Lincon -> Cats. This led to a question of whether or not a human or bot could do the job better, if the bot were limited to some small amount of code.

This is a naieve implementation of a breadth-first-search across the wiki page, so please pull the wiki locally so you don't spam their servers.
